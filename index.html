          <h5>Who Am I?</h5>
          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p>I'm Ross Fairgrieve. You probably guessed that.<br><br>
          I currently work as
          a cameraperson and video editor, based in Reading. I've had the
          pleasure of working for all sorts of organisations, many of whom do
          some really important work.<br><br>
          Now, however, I'm ready for a new challenge. I want to combine my creativity
          with my natural nerdyness, to create tools that make
          the world a little bit better than it was before.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brain brain2">
          <h5>Why Founders & Coders?</h5>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>I recently took myself back to university, studying a master's degree
          in Environmental Technology at Imperial College London. While trying to
          build a MATLAB model to help Tanzanian farmers get drought insurance,
          I fell in love with software as a means for making the world a better place.<br><br>
          In the Founders & Coders course, I see an opportunity to not only learn
          web development, but also to join a community of people who want to use
          technology for more than just adding zeros to a bottom line.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brain brain3">
          <h5>How Will I Approach the Course?</h5>
          <h3>How?</h3>
          <p>As your nan always said (probably), if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing properly.
          I graduated with the highest mark in my year in both my undergraduate degree
          and my master's degree and I plan on bringing this same level of effort and
          enthusiasm to Founders & Coders.<br><br>
          I'm a huge proponent of collaborative learning. I believe that,
          by helping other people learn, you gain a better level of understanding
          yourself. And when I inevitably get stuck, I really appreciate the helping hand!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="brain brain4">
          <h5>What do I want to do after the course?</h5>
          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>I'd love to find a job building tools that have a positive social and/or
            environmental impact; something that will also keep pushing me to learn and improve.<br><br>
            I'd also really like to get involved with future Founders & Coders cohorts,
            both to pay forward the time and effort invested in me and
            to keep meeting great people who are looking to use coding to make a difference.</p>

      <h2>What have I been up to?</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>1985</h5>
            <p>I was born.<br><br>To be honest, I didn't have a huge amount of
              input into this so I can't really take any credit. I was also so
              ugly that I think my mum was tempted to put me back.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>1986 - 1988</h5>
            <p>My memory of this time is a little hazy. I'm reliably informed
            that I used it wisely though, learning to walk, talk and use a toilet. This all proved to be a
            great idea as, by a happy coincidence, I'd end up using all of these
            skills regularly in later life.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>1988 - 1996</h5>
            <p>I spent most of this period pretending (knowing) that I was Batman.
            The rest of the time was spent jumping off of things and avoiding,
            at all costs, the incomparable shame that comes with accidentally
            calling the teacher "Mum".</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>1997 - 2004</h5>
            <p>I went to secondary school, where I expanded my previous skill set – largely
            consisting of eating play-doh and doing colouring in – to include things like maths, physics,
            english and geography (or "colouring in" as it's also known).
            I also once tried to jump over a metal railing and put one of the spikes
            through my leg. At this point, I realised that I might not be Batman.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2004 - 2005</h5>
            <p>A love of the outdoors, and particularly the oceans, led me to take
            a year out of education to train as a PADI scuba diving instructor.
            I started my training in the tropical waters of the Gulf of Thailand
            and finished it off in a quarry near Heathrow Airport.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2005 - 2008</h5>
            <p>A love of quarries near Heathrow Airport led me to study a degree
            in oceanography at the University of Southampton, specialising in the
            maths and physics of the sea. I really enjoyed the technical and
            analytical nature of the subject and I graduated with a first class
            honours degree and the highest mark on the course.</p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2008 - 2010</h5>
            <p>It turns out that graduating at the peak of the worst financial
            crisis since the Great Depression makes it a little bit tricky to
            get employed. I took a temporary, any-port-in-a-storm job, making cups of tea
            and photocopying things at a forensic accounting company.<br><br>This job
            took a turn for the odd when the only person in the company who was
            capable of running the bespoke software that found financial anomalies,
            disappeared...with the software. My boss asked me if I fancied having a go at writing
            new scripts so that the business could actualy still function. Despite
            the small matter of having next to no programming experience, I took
            him up on the challenge. Two weeks later, we had new testing algorithms
            that were much faster and more thorough than the original ones and,
            nine months later, I was made the head of the largest department in
            the business.
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2010 - 2011</h5>
            <p>What was supposed to be a three-month contract to save up for some travelling,
            had turned into two years of happy number-crunching. I never intended
            to end up working in the financial sector, however, and I did eventually leave to
            see a bit more of the world and to find out how I might be able to use
            my career to do something that I considered to be a bit more important.<br><br>
            While I was away, I used a hobby of mine
            – making videos – to help promote the work of a couple of charities.
            When I saw the positive impact that these efforts had, I realised that
            videos could be used, not just for watching cats falling off of things
            and then pretending that they meant to fall off of things,
            but also to make a real difference in the world.

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2011 - 2015</h5>
            <p>I've been working as a freelance film-maker since 2011 and have
              had the pleasure of working for a huge range of organisations from
              the University of Oxford and the National Oceanography Centre, to
              the Institute for Cancer Research and Prostate Cancer UK. Many
              of my clients are doing really groundbreaking work and it's
              been a great priviledge to witness this first-hand while helping,
              in some small way, to promote their endeavours.</br><br>
              Others aren't doing groundbreaking work. They're just making crisps.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2015 - 2017</h5>
            <p>Towards the end of 2015, I decided to more closely focus my filming
              on the sector that I've had a long-standing passion for: the environment
              and technology. I wanted to improve my own knowledge and so I took myself back to university, studying a
              master's degree in the appropriately titled environmental technology, at Imperial College London.
              <br><br>While studying, I re-discovered my love of technical work,
              and particularly programming. I taught myself to code in MATLAB
              and, for my thesis, produced a tool to enable the provision of low-cost
              drought insurance for previously uninsurable smallhold farmers in Tanzania.
              The thesis got a mark of 92%, the highest that my supervisor
              had ever awarded. I also graduated with the highest overall mark out of the 150
              students on the MSc and was awarded the Aecom Prize for Outstanding
              Performance.<br><br>
              <strong>&lt;/showing-off&gt;</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>2017 - Present</h5>
            <p>While I still believe in the importance of video as a means of
              communication, studying my
              master's degree made me realise both how much I enjoy coding
              and how much better suited I am to coding than video production.
              I believe that web development could be a perfect mixture of the technical
              programming that I enjoy so much, and the creativity and lateral thinking that my current
              job allows me to exercise.<br><br>
              Since graduating just under a year ago, I've continued to work in
              video production and I've now saved enough money to cover my financial
              commitments (Batmobile insurance etc.)
              while I train to become a web developer. If you'll have me,
              I'm ready!
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div>
            <h5>Present - Future</h5>
            <p>I'd love to be a part of Founders & Coders. I have no interest in
              expending blood sweat and tears to become the best web developer that I can, only to sell my soul to a bank. It's
              Founders & Coders' emphasis on giving people the skills to create software
              that makes the world a better place, that has me hooked.<br><br>
              I'm also really attracted to the collaborative, collective approach
              that Founders & Coders takes. I'd love the opportunity to be a part
              of a community that's dedicated to helping each other and using our
              newly-developed skills to make a real difference.

        I'd be really grateful if you'd consider my application and I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
        I believe that I was meant to be a web developer. My parents actually named
        me after the very well-known bug discovered in the early days of the internet, whereby typing <em>'ross'</em>
        would inexplicably trigger random lines from <em>'Solid'</em>, by 80s soul
        duo Ashford & Simpson – a bug that I understand hasn't been entirely eradicated even to this day.
